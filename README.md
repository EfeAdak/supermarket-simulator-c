# 🛒 Supermarket Queue Simulator (C)

This project is a **single-cashier supermarket queue simulation** developed using the C programming language.  
Customers arrive at random intervals, each customer has a random number of goods, and the cashier processes them using the **FIFO (First In First Out)** logic.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a practical demonstration of:

- The Queue data structure  
- Random number generation  
- Time-step based simulation  
- Modeling a real-life system (supermarket cashier) with software  

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Single cashier system  
- ✅ Single queue (FIFO)  
- ✅ Random customer arrivals  
- ✅ Random goods count for each customer  
- ✅ Time-step based simulation (1-second loop)  
- ✅ Customers leave the queue when their goods are fully processed  
- ✅ Real-time status output on the console  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Queue data structure  
- `struct` usage  
- Random number generation with `rand()` and `srand()`  
- Time control using `Sleep`  
- Loops (`while`)

## 🛠️ Compile and Run (Windows)

Open the terminal in the project folder and run:

gcc main.c -o market
market


The simulation will start automatically after running the program.

## 📁 File Structure

- `main.c` → Source code  
- `market.exe` → Compiled executable file (not uploaded to GitHub)
